Welcome to my personal portfolioâ€”a curated space where I showcase my technical proficiency and creative projects across IT support, full-stack web development, system administration, and cybersecurity.

Every tool and demo featured hereâ€”from password generators to ticket management systemsâ€”is built with modern design principles and practical, user-friendly interfaces. I aim to demonstrate not just what Iâ€™ve learned, but how I solve problems and build intuitive solutions from the ground up.

This portfolio is a living document of my growth. Iâ€™ll continue updating it as I explore new technologies, complete new certifications, and refine my craft.

ðŸ“Œ Iâ€™m currently available and actively seeking work in the tech industryâ€”whether itâ€™s remote, freelance, or full-time. If you like what you see, Iâ€™d love to hear from you.
